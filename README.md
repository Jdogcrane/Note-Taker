## General overview: 

<p style="font-family:georgia"> 
For this project my goal was to create a Note Taker Web Application that will allow the user to create a note save it, view it and delete it using express & JavaScript. I built the server.js file from a collection of notes and general knowledge to successfully setup express and link the backend to the front end. The user will now be able to use the site to take notes, save, delete and view them with a click of a button.
